								<h2>Diary overall</h2>
									<p>The "diary" can be kept in three different ways</p>
									<ol>
										<li>Via direct messages to one of the accounts listed above</li>
										<li>As a fill-in Word document</li>
										<li>Paper-based</li>
									</ol>
									<p>The first option via direct messages would be the preferred method, but you are welcome to choose any of the other two.</p>
									</p>

						<!-- Questionnaire -->
						<section id="first" class="main">
								<header class="major">
								<h2>Diary questions</h2>
									<p>You would be asked to provide entries when opening the app, at specific points during the usage session and at the end. Two exemplary scenarios are given below in case you are not a hundred percent sure what to do just from reading the single steps:</p>
									<ol>
										<li>Opening the app:</li>
											<ul>
												<li>What were you just doing, what are you doing while using the app?</li>
													<ul>
														<li>Bsp.: "Done doing the daily chores, now just lying on the sofe" or "Standing at the bus stop waiting for the bus to arrive"</li>
													</ul>
												<li>What motivation do you have using the app?</li>
													<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
														<li>Please, do not think too much when doing these entries. If you after opening app realise you just opened it without any conscious motivation, just write that.</li>
													</ul>
											</ul>
										<li>During Session:</li>
											<ul>
												<li>If you are searching something in the search bar, please record what you typed in word by word</li>
												<li>If you send a video to a friend / share it with a friend or save it for later usage, please also share it with researcher account and why you shared / saved it (in case you are using the paper-based or desktop-version, please shortly describe the video)</li>
											</ul>
										<li>At the end of the session:</li>
											<ul>
												<li>Wie did you stop using the app?</li>
											</ul>
									</ol>

								<h2>Further information</h2>
									<p>
										The diary period should be one week. Please choose a week, where your life is as everydayish as possible. So, not while you are travelling or on holiday. If you use multiple of the aforementioned systems simultaneously, just use the system you are currently using to write a message to the researcher.
										Die Zeit, in der du die oben genannten Schritte ausführst sollte eine Woche betragen und wenn möglich eine Alltagswoche sein. Also z.B. am besten nicht wenn du gerade Urlaub machst. Solltest du parallel mehrere der oben genannten Systeme nutzen, schreibe mir gerne auf der jeweiligen App, auf der du gerade bist.
										<br>

									Thank you again for considering participating in my master's thesis project. Following you find two exemplary scenarios.

								<h2>Scenario 1</h2>
									<p>Max is standing at a bus stop, waiting for the bus. Being bored, he takes out his phone and opens TikTok. At that moment, he writes to the researcher: "Standing at the bus stop, waiting for the bus. Opened TikTok to pass the time." While scrolling, he comes across a video of dancing cats. He sends the video to a friend. After sending it, he also sends it to the researcher along with the message "Thought the video was funny, sent it to a friend because she has a similar sense of humor and will probably find it funny too." A few swipes later, he comes across a book recommendation. He saves it as the book looks interesting. After saving it, he sends the video to the researcher and writes, "The book looked interesting. Might want to buy it. Saved it to find it again later." Max sees the bus approaching and writes to the researcher, "Closing TikTok, as the bus is coming."

									In case Max chooses the paper-based form, he would have recorded the messages he wrote to the researcher in the above example on the paper template and briefly described the videos.

								<h2>Scenario 2</h2>
									<p>
										Anna is having dinner when she realizes that she hasn't seen anything from content creator Ashley in a long time. She opens Instagram and searches for the creator's name. In the search results, she also sees a Reel. She clicks on it. She writes to the researcher, "I just remembered during dinner that I haven't heard from content creator Ashley in a while, wanted to check out new posts from content creator Ashley, but now I've ended up on Instagram Reels." After scrolling through Instagram Reels for a while, Anna finishes eating and closes the app. Before that, she writes to the researcher, "I just wanted to quickly check out posts from content creator Ashley, but then got stuck on Reels, but now I'm done with dinner."
