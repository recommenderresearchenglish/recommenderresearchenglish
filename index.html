										<h2>Introduction</h2>
										<p>Thank you for your interest in participating in my study on everyday usage of Video Social Recommender Systems such as TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts. On this webpage, you will find all the information you need to participate. After reading through the Diary section, you can navigate directly to the section relevant to the app you are using. Additionally, at the bottom of the webpage, you will find two sample scenarios illustrating how a diary section could look.<br>
										If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to message me on any of the following platforms:
										</p>
										<ul font-size:16>
											<li><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@vsrs_researcher" target="_blank">Tik Tok</a></li>
											<li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/vsrs_researcher/" target="_blank">Instagram</a></li>
											<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2PcY_MBBuskY7mpMNs12wQ" target="_blank">YouTube</a></li>
										</ul>
										<p>or write an email to:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>weberjay[at]hu-berlin.de</li>
										</ul>
										<p>
										Here's how the process works: Once you express your interest in participating via an email or a direct message, I will send you a unique participant number along with a link to a brief demographic survey and information on data protection. After that, you can get started with the study.
										<br>
										<br>
										Thank you once again for your interest in my Master's thesis project. I would be thrilled if you choose to participate! If you'd like to learn more about me, you can find additional information on my <a href="https://janrweber.github.io/" target="_blank">website</a>.

								<h2>Diary</h2>
									<p>The diary is kept by sending direct messages to me within the respective app. What information should be send is illustrated in the app-specific sections.
										The diary period should cover one week, ideally during a typical, everyday routine. Please avoid selecting a week when you are on holiday. If you use multiple systems simultaneously, simply use the system you are currently using to send a message to me.</p>

								<h2>Scenario 1</h2>
									<p>Max is currently standing at a bus stop, waiting for the bus. Feeling bored, she takes out his phone and opens TikTok. At that moment, she writes a message to the researcher, saying, "Standing at the bus stop, waiting for the bus. Opened TikTok to pass the time." While scrolling through the app, she comes across a video of dancing cats that catches her attention. She decides to send the video to a friend. Additionally, she also sends it to the researcher, explaining, "Thought the video was funny, so I sent it to a friend who shares a similar sense of humor and will probably find it funny too."<br>
									A few swipes later, Max comes across a book recommendation that piques her interest. Finding the book intriguing, she saves it for future reference. After saving it, she sends the video to the researcher, mentioning, "The book looked interesting. I might want to buy it. I saved it to find it again later."

									As Max sees the bus approaching, she writes her final message to the researcher, stating, "Closing TikTok now, as the bus is coming."

									In case Max chooses the paper-based form, she would have recorded the messages she wrote to the researcher in the above example on the paper template and provided brief descriptions of the videos.

								<h2>Scenario 2</h2>
									<p>
										Steve is in the middle of dinner when he realizes that he hasn't seen any content from creator Dustin in a long time. Prompted by this thought, he opens Instagram and searches for the creator's name. In the search results, he also encounters a Reel, which he proceeds to click on. He promptly messages the researcher, saying, "I just remembered during dinner that I haven't seen anything from content creator Dustin in a while. I wanted to check out new posts from her, and have now ended up scrolling through her Reels."
										After spending some time scrolling through Instagram Reels, Steve finishes his meal and closes the app. Just before doing so, he writes to the researcher, "I initially intended to quickly check out posts from content creator Dustin, but then got caught up in Reels. Now that I'm done with dinner, I'm closing the app."
